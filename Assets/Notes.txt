Anything not created by me is in the Third party folder. All art assets and Text mesh pro imported as I prefer how that looks compared to the default text.

Asteroid pool and Bullet pool contain the object pools for the corresponding objects.
Created a pool for each so there can be different asteroid or bullet types added with different pools.
Singleton pattern implemented on pools and the GameManager to refernce them from other scripts.


Future additions:
	-Powerups spawn from asteroids
		-Immunity (Partially implemented)
		-Multishot
		-Laser shot
		-Bombs
		-Extra lives
	-Scoreboard 
		-Local highscore is stored using player prefs

TODO:
- The movement code in Asteroid/PowerUp/PlayerBullet with fSpeed and Update can be shared in either a base class or a shared component
- OOBCheck.cs Take into account the movement direction to allow the OOB to be closer to the camera edges.
